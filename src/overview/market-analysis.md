# Market Analysis

## Problem

- Portfolio management includes trading activities as well as the periodic assessment and analysis of the investment portfolio.
- Staying informed about market trends, analysing data, and making informed investment decisions require significant time and effort, even for experienced investors.
- Traditional analysis methods may not be able to uncover hidden patterns and correlations within larger financial datasets.
- Although traditional methods can track and analyse factors affecting markets such as political, economic, and company related variables, there are limitations due to complex interactions between those factors.

## Target Market

- Individual Investors
- Financial Advisors
