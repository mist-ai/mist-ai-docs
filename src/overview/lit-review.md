# Literature Review

## Portfolio Construction:

- Diversification
- Modern Portfolio Theory
  - Efficient frontier: Set of optimal portfolios with highest expected return for a lowest risk.
    - To construct the efficient frontier,
      - Expected returns of each asset in the portfolio
      - Risk aka standard deviation of the returns of each asset
      - Covariance, correlation between the return of different assets

## Portfolio Management

Optimal periodical reallocation of capital into different financial assets (stocks, securities, bonds, commodities, currencies and diverse kinds of funds) to pursue expected returns with a predefined minimum risk.

Finance managers are always researching for new ideas different technologies to increase profit. [1] -> 2

Portfolio management requires monitoring investments overtime, involving investments such as stocks, bonds, funds, etc.

- Types of stocks
- Factors affecting the stock markets:
  - Political factors
  - Economic factors
  - Psychological factors
  - Company related variables

## Portfolio Selection

Process of selecting a portfolio may be divided in to two stages:

```
1. First stage starts with observation and experience and end with beliefs about the future performance of available securities.
2. Second stage starts with the relevant beliefs about the future performances and ends with the choice of portfolio.

```

Rules:

```
1. The investor does (or should) maximise discounted expected, or anticipated returns.
2. The investor does (or should) consider expected return a desirable thing and variance of return an undesirable thing.
3. The investor does (or should) maximise the discounted (or capitalised) value of future returns.

```

Notes:

- Anticipated returns include an allowance for risk.

Assumptions made in the process:

```
1. We assume that investor does (or should) act as if he had probability beliefs concerning these variables.
2. In general we would expect that the investor could tell us, for any two events (A and B), whether he personally considered A more likely than B, B more likely than A, or both equally likely. If the inverstor were consistent in his opinions on such mattes, he would possess a system of probability beliefs.
3. We cannot expect the investor to be consistent in every detail. We can however, expected his probability beliefs to be roughly consistent on important matters that have been carefully considered.
4. We should also expect that he will base his actions upon these probability beliefs- even though they be in part subjective.

```

## Selecting the portfolio

```
- For fixed probability beliefs (known expected values, covariances) the investor has a choice of various combinations of E and V depending on his choice of portfolio X1, X2, â€¦ XN

- Rules
    - Minimum V for given E or more
    - Maximum E for given V or less

- Given means and covariances there are techniques by which we can compute the set of efficient portfolios and efficient  (E,V) combinations.

```

NOTE:

```
* The investor, being informed of what (E,V) combinations were attainable, could state which he desired.
* We could then find the portfolio which gave this desired combination.
* CONDITIONS MUST BE SATISFIED BEFORE IT WOULD BE PRACTICAL:
    * Investor must desire to act according to the E-V maxim
    * We must be able to arrive at reasonable means and covariances

```
